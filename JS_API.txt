For this assignment, you'll be creating a website to display data from an API created by one of two sources:
- Chicago Art Institute. You'll be using their API to create an 'art gallery' website displaying your favorite paintings. Bonus points if clicking on the images results in either a pop-up window or some other creative way of displaying data about the artwork. Documentation is included below. Please note that because of the way the institute's API is set up, you will likely need to save the images to a folder in your application the same way you did for your regular HTML/CSS projects, and then you'll use the API to display data about the paintings. The images themselves are not in the JSON. The API will be the data about the image; linking the two in a visually appealing way is the goal here.
- CoinLayer API. Your goal will be to make a cryptocurrency website that shows current prices of crypto such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. Be sure to display the prices in a clean, useful way. Documentation is below.
